# elearning-landing-page
e-learning landing page (HTML CSS) built via Front End Mentor challenges

Link to project: https://helpful-bublanina-545078.netlify.app/

How it’s Made:
Tech used: HTML/CSS

Brief:
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
(original brief: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q)

Ideas:
I wanted the landing page to closely follow the brief detailed by frontend mentor (using their detailed Figma file).
Flex-box and Grid would come in handly as well as utilising background images.

Set up:
My methodology for this project focuses on ‘mobile-first’ design principles.
